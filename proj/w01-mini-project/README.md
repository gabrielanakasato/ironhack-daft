# TIC-TAC-TOE

This tic-tac-toe is a simple game created using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## MOTIVATION

This is the result of the first mini-project for the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp, putting all the knowledge acquired during the first week into practice.

## THE GAME

This game can be played by one or two people (if there is just one person, (s)he will play against the CPU). Before the actual game starts, the CPU will filp a coin to decide who makes the first move. After that, each player marks a space with an O or X in a grid 3 x 3. The first one who places three of their mark in a row (row, column or diagonal) wins the game.

## LEARNING PROCESS

### CHALLENGES

- Establish the relationship between the return of the functions created and the gameflow;
- Use ANSI escape code;
- Find logic errors.

### THEORY APPLIED

- [x] String manipulation
- [x] List, Dictionary, Set and Tuple
- [x] List Comprehension
- [x] Functions
- [x] Recursive Functions
- [x] Class
- [x] Error Handling

### IMPROVEMENTS

- Visual interface and sounds;
- Rename the columns to A, B and C;
- CPU improvement and levels of difficult.
