## Objective

The objective of this project was to create a simple game, practicing everything learned during the week. The game created was a simple tic-tac-toe.

## Resources

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## The Game: Tic-tac-toe 

This game can be played by one or two people (if there is just one person, (s)he will play against the CPU). Before the actual game starts, the CPU will filp a coin to decide who makes the first move. After that, each player marks a space with an :o: or :x: in a grid 3 x 3. The first one who places three of their mark in a row (row, column or diagonal) wins the game.

## Learning Process

### Challenges

- Establish the relationship between the return of the functions created and the gameflow;
- Use ANSI escape code;
- Find logic errors.

### Theory Applied

- [x] String manipulation
- [x] List, Dictionary, Set and Tuple
- [x] List Comprehension
- [x] Functions
- [x] Recursive Functions
- [x] Class
- [x] Error Handling

### Improvements

- Visual interface and sounds;
- Rename the columns to A, B and C;
- CPU improvement and levels of difficult.
